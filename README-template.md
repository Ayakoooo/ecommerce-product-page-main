## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to effectively use React and Next.js to build a dynamic and responsive e-commerce product page. Here are some code snippets that I am particularly proud of:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to focus on improving my skills in the following areas:

- Advanced React patterns
- Performance optimization
- Accessibility best practices

### Useful resources

- [React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - This helped me understand the core concepts of React.
- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - This is an amazing resource for learning Next.js.
